# Building With Active Record
- This is a junior version of the model of the Reddit site. In this project, I'll build the data structures necessary to support link submissions and commenting. There will be no need for a front end. I will use the Active Record ORM and Rails Console to play around with models without the overhead of making HTTP requests and involving controllers or views.The scope of the project includes:

  - Data Structures & Relationships
  - Migrations

## Built With

- Ruby on Rails
- Sqlite3 (development)
- Rubocop Linter
- Stickler CI
